# Flipkart-Web-Scrapping


This Python script serves as a web scraping utility designed to extract comprehensive information concerning mobile phones listed on the Flipkart platform, with a particular focus on devices priced below 50,000 INR. The acquired data is subsequently stored in a CSV file, which is generated within the designated folder specified during execution. To accomplish this task, the script effectively employs widely used libraries such as Pandas, Requests, and BeautifulSoup, enabling it to efficiently scrape and extract data from the Flipkart website.
